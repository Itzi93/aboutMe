<p>My name is Itziar. I'm 24 years old and I was born in Madrid, Spain.<br>
  I studied a Degree in Business Administration and Management and I finished it in 2011. I started my professional career an
  IT recruiter working in different consulting companies.<br>
  After that, I got my last job in beBee, an Affinity Social Network as HR Manager where I've been working for 1 year.
  I worked very closely with the IT team, so my curiosity made me to start studying online programming courses.<br>
  I came to San Francisco in August of 2017 to start a new professional career and personal challenge.
  I decided that It would be my moment to learn something new and maybe, to get a job in a new industry. So, I enrolled on the
  Front-End Web Development course that General Assembly offered.<br>
  I hope this course can help me in getting the professional expectations that I have right now.</p>
